Do you get excited by the challenge of scaling a fast-growing company by powering it with data, reporting, and analytics? Do you have a strong bias towards action? Are you good at finding patterns in messy datasets, or making decisions with incomplete information?

We’re growing quickly, so you'll need to define, implement, and scale the systems and processes for delivering data to your colleagues across the Product org.
Product Analytics at Atlassian is multidisciplinary. The perfect teammate is someone who has the skills to surface insights quickly, and communicate those insights in a way that drives action. You'll use SQL, R, and Python to explore the data and answer difficult questions, but you'll spend an equal amount of time on delivery - blogging, reporting, running training courses, writing documentation, and building the data muscle at Atlassian. There is massive opportunity to improve our analytics infrastructure and processes, so we can answer increasingly strategic and interesting questions. Your passion for using data to create healthier, happier users will shine through your analysis and change the way your team builds product.
More about you
On your first day, we'll expect you to have:
Knowledge of the product development lifecycle and common Product org structures
Familiarity with event-based analytics, and a curiosity to learn more
Experience collaborating with senior management, to advise and translate data-driven insights into decisions and actions
Advanced proficiency in SQL
Experience with Git
Proficiency in one or more analytics & visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Mode, etc.)

Experience with statistical packages such as R, MATLAB, SPSS, SAS, Stata, etc.
An advanced degree in a quantitative discipline, such as statistics, mathematics, economics, or computer science
More about our team
Atlassian is over a decade old, but the Product Analytics team is just finding its stride. We are blazing new trails to enable meaningful decisions, so we're constantly growing, learning, and trying to do things differently. We're data unicorns that distill complex analytical terminology and concepts into concise language, and we interface directly with Product leaders to transmit that knowledge effectively. We've been described as scrappy, but thorough. We're dedicated to an agile methodology that enables moving fast while still ensuring high-quality output. We know all too well the importance of validating assumptions in our data, and we use various types of testing to prove those assumptions right (or wrong). It's all about enabling Atlassian to grow by delivering the right data in the right way to partners across the company, and we have fun doing it.
More about our benefits
Our offices are open, highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, five paid volunteer days a year for your favorite cause, plenty of food and beverages, ergonomic workstations with sit/stand desks, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years, generous employer-paid insurance coverage (medical, dental, and vision) for you and your family, 401k matching and more.

Data savvy : you have a background in statistics and you feel confident navigating and analyzing large data sets. You’re also comfortable with database design, relational database terminology and can write advanced SQL queries.

Strong problem solver : you live for the thrill of the chase. Naturally curious, you can’t help but dig deeper and get to the root cause of an issue.

Clear communicator : you get your point across with the fewest most impactful words. Talking to customers, you know how and when to simplify complex technical issues vs. get into the nitty gritty.

Collaborative : you thrive working with others to get the job done, and you bring an attitude that helps lighten the load for everyone.

Technical aptitude and interest : you’re extremely comfortable navigating new systems and are excited to learn new tools that help you get the job done quickly and efficiently.

It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.
