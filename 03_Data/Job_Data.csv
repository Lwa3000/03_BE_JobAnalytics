Product Analytics at Atlassian is multidisciplinary. The perfect teammate is someone who has the skills to surface insights quickly, and communicate those insights in a way that drives action. You'll use SQL, R, and Python to explore the data and answer difficult questions, but you'll spend an equal amount of time on delivery - blogging, reporting, running training courses, writing documentation, and building the data muscle at Atlassian. There is massive opportunity to improve our analytics infrastructure and processes, so we can answer increasingly strategic and interesting questions.

We're data unicorns that distill complex analytical terminology and concepts into concise language, and we interface directly with Product leaders to transmit that knowledge effectively. We've been described as scrappy, but thorough. We're dedicated to an agile methodology that enables moving fast while still ensuring high-quality output. We know all too well the importance of validating assumptions in our data, and we use various types of testing to prove those assumptions right (or wrong). It's all about enabling Atlassian to grow by delivering the right data in the right way to partners across the company, and we have fun doing it.
More about our benefits
Our offices are open, highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, five paid volunteer days a year for your favorite cause, plenty of food and beverages, ergonomic workstations with sit/stand desks, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years, generous employer-paid insurance coverage (medical, dental, and vision) for you and your family, 401k matching and more.
