Job Description

We’re seeking a Junior Data Analyst to help the BrightBytes Data Operations team scale our impactful education solutions, providing critical insights to districts across the country. We’re looking for someone with strong analytical skills, who wants to put data into action by helping school districts make better informed decisions. You’ll be working directly with our district customers and data research partners to bring our SIS data powered modules into districts, schools, and classrooms. For you, managing mountains of potentially messy data sounds like a fun way to spend the afternoon -- and wrapping it up in a beautiful, statistically significant bow? All the better.

Here’s what you’d do:
Explore new data sets

Investigate school district raw data and formulate questions to enhance data quality and completeness

Write queries to transform raw data into fantastically clean, normalized datasets

Research and acquire publicly available data to supplement what is available from district student information systems

Create customer-facing materials to help with data verification steps

Train and score statistical models that drive our dashboard

Research and prepare publicly available data sets to support features of additional BrightBytes modules

Generate ad-hoc reports for customers

Analyze internal data and prepare results to be used in marketing, white papers, and customer communications

Data savvy : you have a background in statistics and you feel confident navigating and analyzing large data sets. You’re also comfortable with database design, relational database terminology and can write advanced SQL queries.

Strong problem solver : you live for the thrill of the chase. Naturally curious, you can’t help but dig deeper and get to the root cause of an issue.

Clear communicator : you get your point across with the fewest most impactful words. Talking to customers, you know how and when to simplify complex technical issues vs. get into the nitty gritty.

Collaborative : you thrive working with others to get the job done, and you bring an attitude that helps lighten the load for everyone.

Technical aptitude and interest : you’re extremely comfortable navigating new systems and are excited to learn new tools that help you get the job done quickly and efficiently.

Mission Driven : you care deeply about improving the state of US education and fulfilling the BrightBytes mission of improving the way the world learns.

And here are the requirements:
1+ years of relevant work experience that includes quantitative analysis and client-facing work.

Bachelor’s degree in Economics/Statistics/Business or another quantitative field.

We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

You are excited to work with business folks and cross-functional teams. You are able to run custom queries to retrieve data for different business functions.

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?

We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.
