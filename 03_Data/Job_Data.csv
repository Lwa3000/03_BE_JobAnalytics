EducationSuperHighway is the leading non-profit focused on upgrading the Internet access in every public school classroom in America. We believe that digital learning has the potential to provide all students with equal access to educational opportunity and that every school requires high-speed broadband to make that opportunity a reality. We accelerate broadband upgrades in America’s K-12 schools with data-driven programs and tools.

In partnership with governors and state agencies, we work with school districts to get fiber to schools that need it, to ensure classrooms have robust Wi-Fi, and to make broadband more affordable. Our work served as a catalyst for modernization of the Federal Communications Commission’s $3.9 billion E-rate program, and spurred commitment from 46 governors to upgrade their schools. As a result, 30 million more students gained access to high-speed broadband in the past three years.
EducationSuperHighway is funded by national philanthropic organizations including the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and our mission is supported by America’s leading CEOs.

The Team:
We are responsible for getting schools upgraded to high speed broadband. Data is at the heart of every major accomplishment at ESH and has played a key role in moving the policy needle swiftly to support the work of connecting more schools to affordable internet and scalable fiber connections.

You enjoy defining a structured, analytical approach to help teams answer their questions.

You routinely go above and beyond in your analysis to answer questions at the goal-level, not just the fact-level. You are constantly looking to construct a narrative from the data. You have worked with enough data to know that it can be unreliable and judiciously make assumptions about the data to avoid analysis paralysis. Your teammates remark on your practical and yet creative solutions and seek you out to hash-out new methods, craft emerging story-lines and advise on best practices and tips for using data tools.
