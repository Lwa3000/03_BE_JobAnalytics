The Who, What, Where and Why

Who?

You are one part engineer, one part analyst. You are equally comfortable creating reports on data warehouse as you are creating custom scripts to automate some manual operation.

You are excited to work with business folks and cross-functional teams. You are able to run custom queries to retrieve data for different business functions.

Outside of month end you will be running reports for different business functions (e.g. Tax, Compliance, Revenue) as requirements arise. You will also be busy creating tools to take care of repetitive tasks during month end.

Why?

We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.
